   <pre><h1>1. Write a JavaScript program to create object and create keys
     like "state" and "capital" and take one  array like state and capital. 
     The program should ensure that if you update the state, the capital is also update  dynamically.

    2. Write a JavaScript program to create parent and child objects. When you print the parent object, 
    the child object should be printed automatically as part of it.
    
    
    3. Consider converting the fakestoreapi object data into an array.:

    4.look into shallow and deep copy in js and object properties


 Shallow Copy -->

When a reference variable is copied into a new reference variable using the assignment operator, a shallow copy of the referenced object is created. In simple words, a reference variable mainly stores the address of the object it refers to. When a new reference variable is assigned the value of the old reference variable, the address stored in the old reference variable is copied into the new one. This means both the old and new reference variables point to the same object in memory. As a result, if the state of the object changes through any of the reference variables it is reflected for both. Let us take an example to understand it better.

Example: Below is an example of a shallow copy.

deep copy -->
Deep Copy
Unlike the shallow copy, deep copy makes a copy of all the members of the old object, allocates a separate memory location for the new object, and then assigns the copied members to the new object. In this way, both the objects are independent of each other and in case of any modification to either one, the other is not affected. Also, if one of the objects is deleted the other still remains in the memory. Now to create a deep copy of an object in JavaScript we use JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods. Let us take an example to understand it better.

Example: Below is the example of deep copy.
